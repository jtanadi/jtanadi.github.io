        <h1>Hi, I'm Jesen!</h1>

        <p>Prior to my switch to STEM, I worked as a designer, most recently as a Lead Visual Designer at exhibition design firm Ralph Appelbaum Associates. I was trained as an architect and designer, and received a B.Architecture from the Rhode Island School of Design and an M.F.A. from Cranbrook Academy of Art.</p>
